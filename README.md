##In this task, a chatbot was developed using Python and Natural Language Processing techniques. NLP libraries such as NLTK or spaCy were used to understand and process user queries. The chatbot was designed to respond to basic questions by analyzing the input text and matching it with predefined patterns or intents. This task demonstrates the use of AI and NLP concepts to build an interactive chatbot. The final deliverables include a Python script and a working chatbot capable of answering user queries.
